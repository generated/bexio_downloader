# Bexio Downloader
Bexio Documents - Bulk Downloader
.NET Core Application (can be run on Windows, OSX and Linux)


This console application allows you to bulk download all documents at once. 
It's pretty basic and does just what we needed at the moment (download all or only inbox) 

To run it simply create a `token.txt` in the same directory as the downloader-exe and copy your access token from bexio in it. 
You can create a bexio access token in your settings under: https://office.bexio.com/index.php/admin/apiTokens#/

You can find the compiled application under `BexioDownloader\bin\Release\netcoreapp2.1\win10-x64`

If you would like to request additional options, have questions or need help, send me an email at: ficht@wepfi.ch
